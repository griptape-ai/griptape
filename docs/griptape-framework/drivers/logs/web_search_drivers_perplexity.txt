Griptape is a modular Python framework for building AI-powered applications that securely connect to enterprise data and APIs[1][2]. It offers developers the ability to create AI systems that operate across two dimensions: predictability and creativity[2].

## Key Features

- **AI Agent Framework**: Griptape provides clean abstractions for building Gen AI Agents, Systems of Agents, Pipelines, Workflows, and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) implementations[1].

- **Flexibility**: The framework allows developers to move between predictability and creativity dimensions according to their use case[2].

- **Structures**: Griptape uses structures like sequential pipelines and directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to enforce predictability[2].

- **Tools**: It facilitates creativity by safely prompting LLMs with Griptape Tools that connect to external APIs and data sources[2].

## Griptape Cloud

Griptape Cloud is a platform that extends the capabilities of the Griptape framework:

- **Data Connectors**: Allow users to bring their own data into the cloud for ingestion and transformation[4].

- **Knowledge Bases**: Organize multiple data sources and make them accessible for querying by AI applications[4].

- **Structures**: Custom Python applications powered by LLMs that can be deployed as hosted endpoints[4].

- **Threads**: Enable conversation memory for AI applications[4].

- **Rulesets and Rules**: Shape agent behavior and enhance responses[4].

## Getting Started

1. Install Griptape:
   ```bash
   pip install griptape-all
   ```

2. Set up your OpenAI API key:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

3. Create a Python file (e.g., `app.py`) and import necessary modules from Griptape[3].

4. Build your AI application using Griptape's components such as agents, pipelines, and tools[3].

Griptape offers a powerful and flexible way to create AI-driven applications, from simple chatbots to complex multi-agent systems. Its modular approach allows developers to easily integrate custom tools and external resources, enhancing the capabilities of AI agents[3][4].
