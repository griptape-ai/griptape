Griptape is an end-to-end AI application stack that enables teams of developers to efficiently build, deploy and manage secure AI applications with predictable output.
Griptape gives developers everything they need, from the open source AI framework (Griptape AI Framework) to the execution runtime (Griptape AI Cloud).
🎢 Griptape
AI Framework
- Build your business logic using predictable, programmable python - don’t gamble on prompting.
- Turn any developer into an AI developer.
- Off-Prompt™ gives you better security, performance, and lower costs.
🌩️ Griptape
AI Cloud
- Deploy and run the ETL, RAG, and structures you developed.
- Simple API abstractions.
- Skip the infrastructure management.
- Scale seamlessly so you can grow with your workload requirements.
🔍 Manage &
Monitor
- Monitor directly in Griptape Cloud or integrate with any third-party service.
- Measure performance, reliability, and spending across the organization
- Enforce policy for each user, structure, task, and query
🎢 Griptape AI Framework
Griptape provides clean and clear abstractions for building Gen AI Agents, Systems of Agents, Pipelines, Workflows, and RAG implementations without having to spend weeks learning Gen AI nor need to ever learn Prompt Engineering.
Build
Build ETL pipelines to prep your data for secure LLM access.
Compose
Compose retrieval patterns that give fast, accurate, detailed information.
Write
Write agents, pipelines, and workflows (i.e. structures) to integrate your business logic.
🌩️ Griptape AI Cloud
Skip the infrastructure management. We’ll host and operate everything for you, from the data processing pipeline to the retrieval-ready database to the serverless application runtime. Simple to complex, one layer of the stack or the whole enchilada, we’ve got you covered.
Automated Data Prep
(ETL)
Connect any data source and extract. Prep/transform it (extract, clean, chunk, embed, add metadata). Load it into a vector database index.
Retrieval as a Service
(RAG)
Generate answers, summaries, and details from your own data. Use ready-made retrieval patterns, customize them to fit your use case, or compose your own from scratch (Modular RAG).
Structure Runtime
(RUN)
Build your own AI agents, pipelines, and workflows. Real-time interfaces, transactional processes, batch workloads. Plug them into client applications.

Griptape enables developers to build and deploy AI applications 5x faster with more reliable output.
