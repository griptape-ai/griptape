                             Input: Black-on-black ware is a 20th- and          
                             21st-century pottery tradition developed by the    
                             Puebloan Native American ceramic artists in        
                             Northern New Mexico.                               
                                 Traditional reduction-fired blackware has been 
                             made for centuries by pueblo artists.              
                                 Black-on-black ware of the past century is     
                             produced with a smooth surface, with the designs   
                             applied through selective burnishing or the        
                             application of refractory slip.                    
                                 Another style involves carving or incising     
                             designs and selectively polishing the raised areas.
                                 For generations several families from Kha'po   
                             Owingeh and P'ohwhóge Owingeh pueblos have been    
                             making black-on-black ware with the techniques     
                             passed down from matriarch potters. Artists from   
                             other pueblos have also produced black-on-black    
                             ware.                                              
                                 Several contemporary artists have created works
                             honoring the pottery of their ancestors.
