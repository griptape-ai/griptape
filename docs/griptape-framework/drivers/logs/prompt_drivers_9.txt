                                 Can I use my Mixmaster 4000 to mix paint, or is
                             it only meant for mixing food?

                             Pre-sale question.                                 
                                                                                
                             Explanation: The email is asking about the intended
                             use of the Mixmaster 4000 product, specifically    
                             whether it can be used for mixing paint or if it is
                             only meant for mixing food. This is a question     
                             someone might ask before deciding to purchase the  
                             product, hence it falls under the "Pre-sale        
                             question" category.
