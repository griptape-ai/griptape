                             Output: For a mood described as "Blue sky at dusk,"
                             a fitting CSS color code might be a soft, muted    
                             blue with a hint of purple to capture the          
                             transition from day to night. Here's a suggestion: 
                                                                                
                             ```css                                             
                             color: #4A6FA5;                                    
                             ```                                                
                                                                                
                             This color reflects the calming and serene         
                             atmosphere of a blue sky as it begins to darken at 
                             dusk.
