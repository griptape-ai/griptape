                             *   **You tell it what to do:** You press buttons  
                             or touch the screen, like telling the toy box which
                             toy you want.

                             figures out what you asked for.                    
                             *   **It remembers things:** It has a special place
                             to keep all its toys (information) so it doesn't   
                             forget.

                             picture or game on the screen, like giving you the 
                             toy you asked for!                                 
                                                                                
                             So, you ask, it thinks, it remembers, and then it  
                             shows you the answer!
