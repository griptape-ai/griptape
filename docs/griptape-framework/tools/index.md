## Overview

One of the most powerful features of Griptape is the ability to use tools that can interact with the outside world.
Many of our [Prompt Drivers](../drivers/prompt-drivers.md) leverage the native function calling built into the LLMs. 
For LLMs that don't support this, Griptape provides its own implementation using the [ReAct](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629) technique. 

You can switch between the two strategies by setting `use_native_tools` to `True` (LLM-native tool calling) or `False` (Griptape tool calling) on your [Prompt Driver](../drivers/prompt-drivers.md).

## Tools
Here is an example of a Pipeline using Tools: 

```python
