## Overview

Griptape provides a set of official Tools for common tasks. In general, Griptape-included Tools are designed to be general-purpose and Driver-based for easy integration with different backends.

## Tools

### Audio Transcription

This Tool enables [Agents](../../../griptape-framework/structures/agents.md) to transcribe speech from text using [Audio Transcription Drivers](../../../reference/griptape/drivers/audio_transcription/base_audio_transcription_driver.md).

```python
--8<-- "docs/griptape-framework/tools/official-tools/src/audio_transcription_tool_1.py"
```

### Calculator

This tool enables LLMs to make simple calculations.

```python

### Griptape Cloud Tool

The [GriptapeCloudToolTool](../../../reference/griptape/tools/griptape_cloud_tool/tool.md) integrates with Griptape Cloud's hosted Tools.

**Note:** This tool requires a [Tool](https://cloud.griptape.ai/tools) hosted in Griptape Cloud and an [API Key](https://cloud.griptape.ai/configuration/api-keys) for access.

```python
--8<-- "docs/griptape-framework/tools/official-tools/src/griptape_cloud_tool_tool.py"
```

### Image Query

This tool allows Agents to execute natural language queries on the contents of images using multimodal models.

```python
--8<-- "docs/griptape-framework/tools/official-tools/src/image_query_tool_1.py"
```

### Inpainting Image Generation

This tool allows LLMs to generate images using inpainting, where an input image is altered within the area specified by a mask image according to a prompt. The input and mask images can be provided either by their file path or by their [Task Memory](../../../griptape-framework/structures/task-memory.md) references.

```python
--8<-- "docs/griptape-framework/tools/official-tools/src/inpainting_image_generation_tool_1.py"
```

### Outpainting Image Generation

This tool allows LLMs to generate images using outpainting, where an input image is altered outside of the area specified by a mask image according to a prompt. The input and mask images can be provided either by their file path or by their [Task Memory](../../../griptape-framework/structures/task-memory.md) references.

```python
--8<-- "docs/griptape-framework/tools/official-tools/src/outpainting_image_generation_tool_1.py"
```

### Prompt Image Generation

This tool allows LLMs to generate images from a text prompt.

```python
--8<-- "docs/griptape-framework/tools/official-tools/src/prompt_image_generation_tool_1.py"
```

### Prompt Summary

The [PromptSummaryTool](../../../reference/griptape/tools/prompt_summary/tool.md) enables LLMs summarize text data.

```python
--8<-- "docs/griptape-framework/tools/official-tools/src/prompt_summary_tool_1.py"
```

                             Response: The architecture of Neovim (Nvim) is designed to improve stability, performance, and extensibility. Here are some key points about
                             Nvim's architecture:

                             1. **Decoupled UI**: The Nvim UI is decoupled from the core editor. All UIs, including the built-in TUI (terminal user interface), are plugins
                             that connect to a Nvim server. Multiple Nvim UI clients can connect to the same Nvim editor server.

                             2. **External Plugins**: External plugins run in separate processes, which improves stability and allows those plugins to work without blocking
                             the editor. Even "legacy" Python and Ruby plugins, which use the old Vim interfaces, run out-of-process, so they cannot crash Nvim.

                             3. **Libuv**: Platform and I/O facilities are built upon libuv. Nvim benefits from libuv features and bug fixes, and other projects benefit from
                             improvements to libuv by Nvim developers.

                             4. **Robust API**: Nvim has a robust API, which is used instead of exposing internal test functions like Vim's `test_autochdir()`,
                             `test_settime()`, etc.

                             5. **Feature Inclusion**: Nvim always includes all features, in contrast to Vim, which ships various combinations of 100+ optional features.
                             This reduces the surface area for bugs and removes a common source of confusion and friction for users.

                             6. **External Plugins and Extensions**: Nvim avoids features that cannot be provided on all platforms, delegating those to external
                             plugins/extensions.

                             These architectural decisions make Nvim more stable, extensible, and user-friendly compared to traditional Vim.

                             Output: The architecture of Neovim (Nvim) is designed to enhance stability, performance, and extensibility. Here are the key points:

                             1. **Decoupled UI**: The user interface (UI) is separated from the core editor. All UIs, including the built-in terminal user interface (TUI),
                             are plugins that connect to a Nvim server. This allows multiple UI clients to connect to the same Nvim editor server.

                             2. **External Plugins**: Plugins run in separate processes, which improves stability and prevents them from blocking the editor. Even older
                             Python and Ruby plugins run out-of-process, ensuring they cannot crash Nvim.

                             3. **Libuv**: Nvim's platform and I/O facilities are built on libuv, benefiting from its features and bug fixes. Improvements made by Nvim
                             developers to libuv also benefit other projects.

                             4. **Robust API**: Nvim provides a robust API, avoiding the need to expose internal test functions like Vim does.

                             5. **Feature Inclusion**: Unlike Vim, which ships with various combinations of optional features, Nvim includes all features by default. This
                             reduces bugs and user confusion.

                             6. **External Plugins and Extensions**: Nvim delegates features that cannot be provided on all platforms to external plugins/extensions.

                             These architectural choices make Nvim more stable, extensible, and user-friendly compared to traditional Vim.

### Text To Speech

This Tool enables LLMs to synthesize speech from text using [Text to Speech Drivers](../../../reference/griptape/drivers/text_to_speech/index.md).

```python
--8<-- "docs/griptape-framework/tools/official-tools/src/text_to_speech_tool_1.py"
```

### Variation Image Generation

This Tool allows LLMs to generate variations of an input image from a text prompt. The input image can be provided either by its file path or by its [Task Memory](../../../griptape-framework/structures/task-memory.md) reference.

#### Referencing an Image by File Path

```python
--8<-- "docs/griptape-framework/tools/official-tools/src/variation_image_generation_tool_1.py"
```

#### Referencing an Image in Task Memory

```python
--8<-- "docs/griptape-framework/tools/official-tools/src/variation_image_generation_tool_2.py"
```

### Vector Store

The [VectorStoreTool](../../../reference/griptape/tools/vector_store/tool.md) enables LLMs to query vector stores.

Here is an example of how it can be used with a local vector store driver:

```python
--8<-- "docs/griptape-framework/tools/official-tools/src/vector_store_tool_1.py"
```

### Web Scraper

This tool enables LLMs to scrape web pages for full text, summaries, authors, titles, and keywords. It can also execute search queries to answer specific questions about the page. This tool uses OpenAI APIs for some of its activities, so in order to use it provide a valid API key in `openai_api_key`.

```python
--8<-- "docs/griptape-framework/tools/official-tools/src/web_scraper_tool_1.py"

                             Output: Photosynthesis is the process by which     
                             plants, algae, and certain bacteria convert light  
                             energy, usually from the sun, into chemical energy 
                             in the form of glucose or sugar. This process      
                             involves several steps:                            
                                                                                
                             1. Absorption of light: The process begins when    
                             light is absorbed by proteins containing           
                             chlorophylls (pigments) present in chloroplasts.   
                                                                                
                             2. Conversion of light energy to chemical energy:  
                             The absorbed light energy is used to convert carbon
                             dioxide from the atmosphere and water from the soil
                             into glucose. This conversion process occurs       
                             through a series of chemical reactions known as the
                             light-dependent reactions and the Calvin cycle.    
                                                                                
                             3. Release of oxygen: As a byproduct of these      
                             reactions, oxygen is produced and released into the
                             atmosphere.                                        
                                                                                
                             4. Use of glucose: The glucose produced is used by 
                             the plant for growth and development. It can also  
                             be stored for later use.                           
                                                                                
                             In summary, photosynthesis is a vital process for  
                             life on Earth as it is the primary source of oxygen
                             in the atmosphere and forms the basis of the food  
                             chain.

Extra schema properties can be added to the Tool to allow for more customization if the Driver supports it.
In this example, we add a `sort` property to the `search` Activity which will be added as a [Google custom search query parameter](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/reference/rest/v1/cse/list).
