                             Output: Photosynthesis is the process by which     
                             green plants, algae, and some bacteria convert     
                             light energy, usually from the sun, into chemical  
                             energy stored in glucose. This process is essential
                             for life on Earth as it provides the primary energy
                             source for nearly all ecosystems. Here's how it    
                             works:                                             
                                                                                
                             1. **Light Absorption**: Photosynthesis begins when
                             chlorophyll, the green pigment in plant cells,     
                             absorbs sunlight. This occurs mainly in the        
                             chloroplasts of plant cells.                       
                                                                                
                             2. **Water Splitting**: The absorbed light energy  
                             is used to split water molecules (H₂O) into oxygen,
                             protons, and electrons. This process is known as   
                             photolysis and occurs in the thylakoid membranes of
                             the chloroplasts.                                  
                                                                                
                             3. **Oxygen Release**: The oxygen generated from   
                             the splitting of water is released into the        
                             atmosphere as a byproduct.                         
                                                                                
                             4. **Energy Conversion**: The electrons and protons
                             generated are used to convert the light energy into
                             chemical energy in the form of ATP (adenosine      
                             triphosphate) and NADPH (nicotinamide adenine      
                             dinucleotide phosphate).                           
                                                                                
                             5. **Carbon Dioxide Fixation**: In the Calvin      
                             cycle, which takes place in the stroma of the      
                             chloroplasts, ATP and NADPH are used to convert    
                             carbon dioxide (CO₂) from the atmosphere into      
                             glucose (C₆H₁₂O₆). This process involves a series  
                             of reactions that incorporate CO₂ into organic     
                             molecules.                                         
                                                                                
                             6. **Glucose Formation**: The end product of the   
                             Calvin cycle is glucose, which can be used by the  
                             plant for energy or converted into other           
                             carbohydrates, such as starch and cellulose, for   
                             storage and structural purposes.                   
                                                                                
                             Overall, photosynthesis can be summarized by the   
                             following chemical equation:                       
                                                                                
                             \[ 6CO₂ + 6H₂O + light \ energy \rightarrow C₆H₁₂O₆
                             + 6O₂ \]                                           
                                                                                
                             This equation shows that carbon dioxide and water, 
                             in the presence of light energy, are transformed   
                             into glucose and oxygen.
