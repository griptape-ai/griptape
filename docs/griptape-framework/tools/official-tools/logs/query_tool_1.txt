                             Response: The architecture of Neovim (Nvim) is     
                             designed to improve stability and flexibility. Here
                             are some key points about Nvim's architecture:     
                                                                                
                             1. **Decoupled UI**: The Nvim UI is "decoupled"    
                             from the core editor. All UIs, including the       
                             built-in terminal user interface (TUI), are treated
                             as plugins that connect to a Nvim server. This     
                             allows multiple Nvim UI clients to connect to the  
                             same Nvim editor server.                           
                                                                                
                             2. **External Plugins**: External plugins run in   
                             separate processes. This improves stability and    
                             ensures that these plugins do not block the editor.
                             Even "legacy" Python and Ruby plugins, which use   
                             the old Vim interfaces, run out-of-process,        
                             preventing them from crashing Nvim.                
                                                                                
                             3. **Platform and I/O**: Nvim's platform and I/O   
                             facilities are built upon libuv. This allows Nvim  
                             to benefit from libuv's features and bug fixes, and
                             other projects can benefit from improvements made  
                             to libuv by Nvim developers.                       
                                                                                
                             Overall, Nvim's architecture focuses on enhancing  
                             stability, performance, and user experience by     
                             leveraging modern software design principles.

                             1. **Decoupled UI**: The user interface (UI) of    
                             Nvim is separated from the core editor. All UIs,   
                             including the built-in terminal user interface     
                             (TUI), function as plugins that connect to a Nvim  
                             server. This setup allows multiple Nvim UI clients 
                             to connect to the same Nvim editor server.         
                                                                                
                             2. **External Plugins**: Plugins run in separate   
                             processes, which improves stability and ensures    
                             they do not block the editor. Even older Python and
                             Ruby plugins, which use the traditional Vim        
                             interfaces, operate out-of-process, preventing them
                             from crashing Nvim.                                
                                                                                
                             3. **Platform and I/O**: Nvim's platform and       
                             input/output facilities are based on libuv. This   
                             integration allows Nvim to utilize libuv's features
                             and bug fixes, while also contributing improvements
                             back to libuv that can benefit other projects.     
                                                                                
                             Overall, Nvim's architecture is focused on         
                             improving stability, performance, and user         
                             experience by employing modern software design     
                             principles.
