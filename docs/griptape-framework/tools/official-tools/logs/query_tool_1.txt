                             Response: The architecture of Neovim (Nvim) is     
                             designed to decouple the user interface (UI) from  
                             the core editor. All UIs, including the built-in   
                             terminal user interface (TUI), are treated as      
                             plugins that connect to a Neovim server. This      
                             allows multiple Nvim UI clients to connect to the  
                             same Nvim editor server. External plugins run in   
                             separate processes, which improves stability and   
                             prevents these plugins from blocking the editor.   
                             Even legacy Python and Ruby plugins, which use the 
                             old Vim interfaces, run out-of-process, so they    
                             cannot crash Nvim.                                 
                                                                                
                             Platform and I/O facilities in Nvim are built upon 
                             libuv, which allows Nvim to benefit from libuv     
                             features and bug fixes, and other projects benefit 
                             from improvements to libuv by Nvim developers.

                             back to libuv that benefit other projects.
