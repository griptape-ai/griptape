                             Output: To build Neovim from source on macOS,      
                             follow these summarized steps:                     
                                                                                
                             1. **Check for Breaking Changes**: Before          
                             upgrading, review any breaking changes in the      
                             Neovim repository.                                 
                                                                                
                             2. **Install Prerequisites**: Ensure you have the  
                             necessary build tools and dependencies. On macOS,  
                             you can use Homebrew to install them:              
                                ```bash                                         
                                brew install ninja libtool automake cmake       
                             pkg-config gettext curl                            
                                ```                                             
                                                                                
                             3. **Clone the Neovim Repository**: Use Git to     
                             clone the Neovim source code:                      
                                ```bash                                         
                                git clone https://github.com/neovim/neovim.git  
                                cd neovim                                       
                                ```                                             
                                                                                
                             4. **Choose Build Type**: Decide on the build type 
                             you need (Release, Debug, RelWithDebInfo). For a   
                             standard build, you can proceed with:              
                                ```bash                                         
                                make CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release                   
                                ```                                             
                                                                                
                             5. **Build Neovim**: Use `ninja` for a faster build
                             process:                                           
                                ```bash                                         
                                make                                            
                                ```                                             
                                                                                
                             6. **Install Neovim**: Once the build is complete, 
                             install Neovim:                                    
                                ```bash                                         
                                sudo make install                               
                                ```                                             
                                                                                
                             7. **Optional Tools**: Consider using `ccache` to  
                             speed up rebuilds:                                 
                                ```bash                                         
                                brew install ccache                             
                                ```                                             
                                                                                
                             8. **Troubleshooting**: If you encounter issues,   
                             refer to the troubleshooting section in the build  
                             documentation for common solutions.                
                                                                                
                             These steps provide a general guideline for        
                             building Neovim on macOS. For more detailed        
                             instructions or customization options, refer to the
                             full build documentation on the Neovim GitHub page.
