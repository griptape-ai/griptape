                             implementations. It allows developers to build ETL 
                             pipelines for data preparation, compose retrieval  
                             patterns for fast and accurate information, and    
                             write agents and workflows to integrate business   
                             logic without needing extensive knowledge of       
                             generative AI or prompt engineering.

                             offers automated data preparation (ETL), retrieval 
                             as a service (RAG), and a structure runtime for    
                             building AI agents, pipelines, and workflows.      
                                                                                
                             Griptape aims to turn any developer into an AI     
                             developer by providing predictable, programmable
