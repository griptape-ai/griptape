                             ...

                             Litestar is rigorously typed, and it enforces      
                             typing. For example, if you forget to type a return
                             value for a route handler, an exception will be    
                             raised. The reason for this is that Litestar uses  
                             typing data to generate OpenAPI specs, as well as  
                             to validate and parse data. Thus, typing is        
                             essential to the framework.                        
                             Furthermore, Litestar allows extending its support 
                             using plugins.                                     
                             Litestar has a plugin system that allows the user  
                             to extend serialization/deserialization, OpenAPI   
                             generation, and other features.                    
                                                                                
                             It ships with a builtin plugin for SQL Alchemy,    
                             which allows the user to use SQLAlchemy declarative
                             classes "natively" i.e., as type parameters that   
                             will be serialized/deserialized and to return them 
                             as values from route handlers.                     
                             Litestar also supports the programmatic creation of
                             DTOs with a DTOFactory                             
                             class, which also supports the use of              
                             plugins.                                           
                             Litestar has custom logic to generate OpenAPI 3.1.0
                             schema, include optional generation of examples    
                             using the

                             inspired by pytest. You can define named

                             of the application, and then selective use or      
                             overwrite them.

                             to fill the parameters and directly interact with

                             - The alternative documentation will also reflect  
                             the new query parameter and body:                  
                             In summary, you declare once the types of          
                             parameters, body, etc. as function parameters.     
                             You do that with standard modern Python types.     
                                                                                
                             You don't have to learn a new syntax, the methods  
                             or classes of a specific library, etc.             
                             Just standard Python.                              
                             For example, for an int                            
                             :                                                  
                             item_id: int                                       
                             or for a more complex Item                         
                             model:

                             ...and with that single declaration you get:
