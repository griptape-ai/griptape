                             Django is a high-level Python web framework that   
                             encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic  
                             design. Built by experienced developers, it takes  
                             care of much of the hassle of web development, so  
                             you can focus on writing your app without needing  
                             to reinvent the wheel. It’s free and open source.  
                             - Ridiculously fast.

                             Django was designed to help developers take        
                             applications from concept to completion as quickly 
                             as possible.

                             Django takes security seriously and helps          
                             developers avoid many common security mistakes.    
                             - Exceedingly scalable.

                             10K+ developers. Other PDF SDKs promise a lot -    
                             then break. Laggy scrolling, poor mobile UX, tons  
                             of bugs, and lack of support cost you endless      
                             frustrations. Nutrient’s SDK handles billion-page  
                             workloads - so you don’t have to debug PDFs. Used

                             /item?id=42379974)| 2024-12-10Disclaimer: I'm a    
                             co-founder of Hatchet                              
                             (https://github.com/hatchet-dev/hatchet), which is 
                             a Postgres-backed task queue that supports durable 
                             execution.                                         
                             > Because a step transition is just a Postgres     
                             write (~1ms) versus an async dispatch from an      
                             external orchestrator (~100ms), it means DBOS is   
                             25x faster than AWS Step Functions                 
                             Durable execution engines deployed as an external  
                             orchestrator will always been slower than direct DB
                             writes, but the 1ms delay versus ~100ms doesn't    
                             seem inherent to the orchestrator being external.  
                             In the case of Hatchet, pushing work takes ~15ms   
                             and invoking the work takes ~1ms if deployed in the
                             same VPC, and 90% of that execution time is on the 
                             database. In the best-case, the external           
                             orchestrator should take 2x as long to write a step
                             transition (round-trip network call to the         
                             orchestrator + database write), so an ideal        
                             external orchestrator would be ~2ms of latency     
                             here.                                              
                                                                                
                             There are also some tradeoffs to a library-only    
                             mode that aren't discussed. How would work that    
                             requires global coordination between workers behave
                             in this model? Let's say, for example, a global    
                             rate limit -- you'd ideally want to avoid          
                             contention on rate limit rows, assuming they're    
                             stored in Postgres, but each worker attempting to  
                             acquire a rate limit simultaneously would slow down
                             start time significantly (and place additional load
                             on the DB). Whereas with a single external         
                             orchestrator (or leader election), you can         
                             significantly increase throughput by acquiring rate
                             limits as part of a push-based assignment process. 
                             The same problem of coordination arises if many    
                             workers are competing for the same work -- for     
                             example if a machine crashes while doing work, as  
                             described in the article. I'm assuming there's some
                             kind of polling happening which uses FOR UPDATE    
                             SKIP LOCKED, which concerns me as you start to     
                             scale up the number of workers.

                             Litestar is rigorously typed, and it enforces      
                             typing. For example, if you forget to type a return
                             value for a route handler, an exception will be    
                             raised. The reason for this is that Litestar uses  
                             typing data to generate OpenAPI specs, as well as  
                             to validate and parse data. Thus, typing is        
                             essential to the framework.                        
                             Furthermore, Litestar allows extending its support 
                             using plugins.                                     
                             Litestar has a plugin system that allows the user  
                             to extend serialization/deserialization, OpenAPI   
                             generation, and other features.                    
                                                                                
                             It ships with a builtin plugin for SQL Alchemy,    
                             which allows the user to use SQLAlchemy declarative
                             classes "natively" i.e., as type parameters that   
                             will be serialized/deserialized and to return them 
                             as values from route handlers.                     
                             Litestar also supports the programmatic creation of

                             Litestar has a simple but powerful DI system       
                             inspired by pytest. You can define named           
                             dependencies - sync or async - at different levels 
                             of the application, and then selective use or      
                             overwrite them.                                    
                             Example for DI

                             Litestar supports typical ASGI middleware and ships
                             with middlewares to handle things such as          
                             - CORS

                             Litestar has an authorization mechanism called

                             , which allows the user to define guard functions

                             similarly to Flask - i.e. before_request           
                                                                                
                             and after_request                                  
                             Litestar is fast. It is on par with, or            
                             significantly faster than comparable ASGI          
                             frameworks.
