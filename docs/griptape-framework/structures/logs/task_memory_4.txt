                             based on [Dark Souls](/wiki/Dark_Souls). Miyazaki  
                             admired Martin's previous work and hoped that his

                             narrative than those of the company's earlier      
                             games. Martin was given unrestricted freedom to    
                             design the backstory, while Miyazaki was lead      
                             writer for the in-game narrative. However, the

                             interpretations. The developers concentrated on    
                             environmental scale, stat management, and the      
                             story; the scale required the construction of

                             Cooperative play involves the placing of a summon  
                             sign on the ground, which causes the sign to become
                             visible to online players who have used a          
                             corresponding item. If another player interacts    
                             with the sign, the player who placed the sign is   
                             summoned into their world. Cooperative players     
                             remain in the same world until the boss of the area
                             is defeated or until a summoned player dies and is 
                             returned to their home world. In PvP combat, a     
                             summon sign is used to challenge another player to 
                             a duel, or the player can use additional items to  
                             invade the worlds of others. World hosts may use a

                             Elden Ring takes place in the Lands Between, a     
                             realm influenced by entities called Outer Gods.    
                             Most prominent is the Greater Will, who created the
                             Elden Ring – a collection of runes that govern the 
                             laws of reality. The Greater Will's emissary, the  
                             Two Fingers, made a woman named Marika the Elden   
                             Ring's vessel, ascending her to godhood. She then  
                             formed a religion called the Golden Order alongside
                             a consort, the Elden Lord; two held this title:    
                             Godfrey, a barbarian warlord who was later banished
                             for unknown reasons; and Radagon, Marika's male    
                             alter-ego. Marika also planted a massive golden    
                             tree called the Erdtree that graces the realm's    
                             inhabitants. Finally, she removed the Rune of Death
                             from the Elden Ring and entrusted it to her        
                             wolf-like shadow, Maliketh, causing the deceased   
                             not to pass on but to be reborn through the Erdtree

                             mysterious maiden named Melina, who offers her     
                             assistance in return for being brought to the      
                             Erdtree. After proving their strength, Melina      
                             brings the Tarnished to the Roundtable Hold – a    
                             gathering place for fellow Tarnished – where they  
                             meet the Two Fingers, who reveals that at least two
                             of the Elden Ring's shards, known as Great Runes,  
                             must be collected and brought to the Erdtree to    
                             repair it.                                         
                             Eventually, the Tarnished makes their way to the   
                             foot of the Erdtree, where they duel Morgott to    
                             gain entry. However, even when having the necessary
                             shards, they find the path inside blocked by       
                             thorns. In response, Melina advises the Tarnished  
                             to seek out the Fell God's power, the Flame of     
                             Ruin, and ignite the Erdtree. Alternatively, they  
                             can also form a pact with another outer god, the   
                             corruptive Frenzied Flame. Should the Tarnished use
                             the Flame of Ruin, Melina immolates herself as the 
                             kindling to set the Erdtree alight. No sacrifice is
                             needed if the Frenzied Flame is used, but Melina   
                             abandons the Tarnished.                            
                                                                                
                             As the Erdtree burns, the Tarnished tracks down and
                             kills Maliketh to obtain the Rune of Death,        
                             infusing it into the flames to burn away the       
                             thorns. On their way back to the Erdtree, however, 
                             they are confronted by Gideon, who has gone mad    
                             after learning the truth about the Greater Will,   
                             and Godfrey, who seeks to reclaim the Elden Lord   
                             title. After vanquishing them both, the Tarnished  
                             enters the Erdtree, where they fight and slay both 
                             Radagon and the Elden Beast. Afterward, the        
                             Tarnished gains access to Marika's corpse,         
                             containing the remnants of the Elden Ring, from

                             - The first four endings all have the Tarnished

                             - The default ending; if the Tarnished allied with 
                             no one, the Lands Between are left as is, resulting
                             in the Age of Fracture.                            
                             - If the Tarnished allied with Goldmask, they usher
                             in the Age of Order by enforcing laws into the     
                             Elden Ring.                                        
                             - If the Tarnished allied with Fia, they usher in  
                             the Age of the Duskborn by altering how death works
                             in the Lands Between.                              
                             - If the Tarnished allied with Dung Eater, they    
                             unleash a Blessing of Despair, stripping everyone  
                             in the Lands Between of grace.                     
                                                                                
                             - If the Tarnished conspired with Ranni, they      
                             become her consort and she destroys the Elden Ring,
                             ushering in the Age of Stars.                      
                             - If the Tarnished made a pact with the Frenzied   
                             Flame, they set the Lands Between ablaze, becoming 
                             a Lord of Frenzied Flame. Afterward, Melina, if she
                             is still alive, vows vengeance against the         
                             Tarnished.

                             Mohg seemingly abducted. After slaying Mohg and    
                             Radahn, they discover that Miquella abandoned his  
                             body to pass into the Land of Shadow. Entering the 
                             realm through Miquella's corpse, the Tarnished     
                             continues tracking him by locating aspects of him  
                             throughout the land, which he abandoned to sever   
                             his ties to the Erdtree. Optionally, the Tarnished 
                             can also interact with Miquella's followers: Leda, 
                             one of Miquella's knights; Dane, a monk            
                             disillusioned with the Golden Order; Freyja, a     
                             soldier of Radahn's army; Hornsent, a Land of      
                             Shadow native; Thiollier, a worshipper of          
                             Miquella's female alter-ego, St. Trina; Sir        
                             Ansbach, a former follower of Mohg; and Moore, a   
                             Scarlet Rot creature.                              
                                                                                
                             Miquella's trail leads the Tarnished to the Gate of
                             Divinity, but they find it locked behind magical   
                             thorns, forcing them to confront and kill Messmer  
                             to burn them away using his power. However, upon   
                             nearing the Gate, they are confronted by Miquella's
                             followers, who had turned on each other after his  
                             affection-compelling charm came undone, with the   
                             survivors dependent on the Tarnished's choices.    
                             Confronting Miquella, it is revealed that he had   
                             orchestrated his own abduction and used Mohg's     
                             corpse to revive Radahn as his consort in a divine 
                             ascension ritual. The Tarnished proceeds to kill   
                             both Miquella and Radahn, thwarting the mystic's   
                             ascendency to godhood and preventing his 'Age of

                             Miyazaki remained lead writer for the game's main

                             ite_note-IGNMiyazaki-31) As with many of           
                             FromSoftware's previous games, the story was       
                             designed to be scantily explained; the developers  
                             wanted players to interpret the story for          
                             themselves via [flavor text](/wiki/Flavor_text) and
                             optional discussions with [non-player

                             Miyazaki said he enjoyed writing NPCs with more    
                             detail, believing they are more compelling than    
                             those in his earlier

                             _note-33) In an interview with [IGN](/wiki/IGN),   
                             Miyazaki said he chose to give Martin control over 
                             the backstory because of the restrictions          
                             FromSoftware's method of storytelling placed on    
                             writers. He noted FromSoftware did not want a      
                             linear or story-focused game, and by giving Martin 
                             oversight of a backstory with which the player is  
                             not directly involved, he could allow Martin to    
                             freely design his

                             Production of the game began in early 2017         
                             following the release of [The Ringed

                             Elden Ring was developed alongside [Sekiro: Shadows
                             Die Twice](/wiki/Sekiro:_Shadows_Die_Twice), which 
                             Miyazaki also directed. He said although the combat
                             in Elden Ring has similarities to that in Sekiro,  
                             neither game directly inspired the mechanics of the
                             other.[[33]](#cite_note-XboxInterview-35)[[34]](#ci
                             te_note-36) FromSoftware simultaneously developed  
                             both games using a "co-director" structure in which
                             each of the games had a staff member acting as     
                             director through its first stages of development.  
                             Miyazaki would then provide direction on the game's
                             mechanics, art, and music.[[28]](#cite_note-:0-30) 
                             Yui Tanimura, who previously directed [Dark Souls

                             Souls III](/wiki/Dark_Souls_III), served as        
                             co-director for the game.[[35]](#cite_note-37) The 
                             design team of Elden Ring concentrated on          
                             environmental scale, role-playing, and storytelling
                             as the main elements.                              
                                                                                
                             Developers credited the scale with responsibility  
                             for creating a sense of diversity, and intended the
                             roleplaying elements to allow for a variety of     
                             player-environment interactions. Increasing the    
                             game's scale required the creation of several      
                             explorable structures, which the team conjoined in
