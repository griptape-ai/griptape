                             majestic atmosphere. The sky is a mix of orange,   
                             pink, and blue hues, with some clouds adding

                             worldwide. It typically consists of vinegared rice 
                             paired with a variety of ingredients, such as      
                             seafood, vegetables, and occasionally tropical     
                             fruits. Sushi can be presented in several forms,   
                             including:                                         
                                                                                
                             1. **Nigiri**: Small rice balls topped with a slice
                             of fish or other seafood.                          
                             2. **Sashimi**: Thinly sliced raw fish or seafood, 
                             served without rice.                               
                             3. **Maki**: Rice and fillings rolled in seaweed   
                             (nori) and sliced into bite-sized pieces.          
                             4. **Uramaki**: Similar to maki, but with the rice 
                             on the outside and the seaweed wrapping the        
                             fillings.

                             rice, seafood, and vegetables.                     
                                                                                
                             Sushi is often accompanied by soy sauce, pickled   
                             ginger, and wasabi, which enhance its flavors. It's
                             a versatile dish that can range from simple to     
                             elaborate, making it a favorite for both casual    
                             dining and special occasions.
