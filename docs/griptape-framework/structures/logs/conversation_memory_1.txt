                             Output: That's interesting! Ligers are fascinating 
                             creatures. They are a hybrid offspring of a male   
                             lion and a female tiger. Ligers typically inherit  
                             physical and behavioral traits from both parents,  
                             often growing larger than either parent species.   
                             They are known for their unique appearance and are 
                             usually found in captivity, as lions and tigers do 
                             not share the same habitats in the wild. What do   
                             you find most interesting about ligers?
