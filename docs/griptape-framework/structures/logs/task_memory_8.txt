                             Output: The Dark Forest Hypothesis is a concept    
                             that suggests that extraterrestrial civilizations  
                             may remain silent and hidden to avoid detection by 
                             potentially hostile alien species. This hypothesis 
                             is based on the idea that the universe is like a   
                             dark forest where every civilization is a hunter,  
                             and revealing one's presence could lead to being   
                             hunted. It is a proposed explanation for the Fermi 
                             Paradox, which questions why we have not yet       
                             detected signs of intelligent extraterrestrial life
                             despite the vastness of the universe.
