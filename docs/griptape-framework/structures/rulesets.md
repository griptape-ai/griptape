## Overview

A [Ruleset](../../reference/griptape/rules/ruleset.md) can be used to define [Rule](../../reference/griptape/rules/base_rule.md)s for [Structures](../structures/agents.md) and [Tasks](../structures/tasks.md). Griptape places Rules into the LLM's system prompt for strong control over the output.

## Types of Rules

### Rule

[Rule](../../reference/griptape/rules/base_rule.md)s shape the LLM's behavior by defining specific guidelines or instructions for how it should interpret and respond to inputs. Rules can be used to modify language style, tone, or even behavior based on what you define.

```python
--8<-- "docs/griptape-framework/structures/src/basic_rule.py"
```

```
[09/10/24 14:41:52] INFO     PromptTask b7b23a88ea9e4cd0befb7e7a4ed596b0
                             Input: Hi there! How are you?
                    INFO     PromptTask b7b23a88ea9e4cd0befb7e7a4ed596b0
                             Output: Ahoy, matey! I be doing just fine, thank ye fer askin'. How be the winds blowin' in yer sails today?
```

### Json Schema

[JsonSchemaRule](../../reference/griptape/rules/json_schema_rule.md)s defines a structured format for the LLM's output by providing a JSON schema.
This is particularly useful when you need the LLM to return well-formed data, such as JSON objects, with specific fields and data types.

!!! warning
  `JsonSchemaRule` may break [ToolkitTask](../structures/tasks.md#toolkittask) which relies on a specific [output token](https://github.com/griptape-ai/griptape/blob/e6a04c7b88cf9fa5d6bcf4c833ffebfab89a3258/griptape/tasks/toolkit_task.py#L28).


```python
--8<-- "docs/griptape-framework/structures/src/json_schema_rule.py"
```

```
[09/10/24 14:44:53] INFO     PromptTask fb26dd41803443c0b51c3d861626e07a
                             Input: What is the sentiment of this message?: 'I am so happy!'
[09/10/24 14:44:54] INFO     PromptTask fb26dd41803443c0b51c3d861626e07a
                             Output: {
                               "answer": "The sentiment of the message is positive.",
                               "relevant_emojis": ["😊", "😃"]
                             }
```

Although Griptape leverages the `schema` library, you're free to use any JSON schema generation library to define your schema!

For example, using `pydantic`:

```python
--8<-- "docs/griptape-framework/structures/src/json_schema_rule_pydantic.py"
```

```
[09/11/24 09:45:58] INFO     PromptTask eae43f52829c4289a6cca9ee7950e075
                             Input: What is the sentiment of this message?: 'I am so happy!'
                    INFO     PromptTask eae43f52829c4289a6cca9ee7950e075
                             Output: {
                               "answer": "The sentiment of the message is positive.",
                               "relevant_emojis": ["😊", "😄"]
                             }
answer='The sentiment of the message is positive.' relevant_emojis=['😊', '😄']
```

## Structure

### Rulesets

You can define a Ruleset at the Structure level if you need to have certain behaviors across all Tasks.

```python
--8<-- "docs/griptape-framework/structures/src/rulesets_1.py"
```

```
[09/29/23 13:44:35] INFO     PromptTask 0ecf932b1602493781485de37028f1df

                             your back foot on the tail and your front foot across the skateboard. Push down on the tail
                             while dragging the edge of your front foot up the board. Then, jump and flick your front foot
                             out to the side. Practice makes perfect, so keep trying!
                    INFO     PromptTask 1f7f5c0af17240dc8cb785d7efbdbfb6

                             skateboard. Push down on the tail while dragging the edge of your front foot up the board.
                             Then, jump and flick your front foot out to the side. Practice makes perfect, so keep trying!

                             trying.
```

### Rules

You can pass [rules](../../reference/griptape/structures/structure.md#griptape.structures.structure.Structure.rules) directly to the Structure to have a Ruleset created for you.

```python
--8<-- "docs/griptape-framework/structures/src/rulesets_2.py"
```
```

                             Output: 👍👍👍👍👍
```

## Task

### Rulesets

You can define a Ruleset at the Task level if you need to have different behaviors per Task.

```python
--8<-- "docs/griptape-framework/structures/src/rulesets_3.py"
```

```
[09/29/23 13:39:22] INFO     PromptTask 0950581dd35e403c9fc51d246861bfc9

```

### Rules

You can pass [rules](../../reference/griptape/mixins/rule_mixin.md#griptape.mixins.rule_mixin.RuleMixin.rules) directly to the Task to have a Ruleset created for you.

```python
--8<-- "docs/griptape-framework/structures/src/rulesets_4.py"
```
```
[09/25/23 16:29:05] INFO     PromptTask d1cc2c0b780d4b32b6309ceab11173f4
                             Input: How are you?

                             }
```
