                             Output: In the hush of dawn's first light,         
                             Whispers dance on morning's breeze,                
                             Nature's canvas, pure and bright,                  
                             Awakens with the rustling trees.                   
                                                                                
                             Golden rays kiss dewdrops fair,                    
                             Glistening on the meadow's face,                   
                             A symphony of colors rare,                         
                             In this tranquil, sacred space.                    
                                                                                
                             Birds compose their morning song,                  
                             Melodies that gently rise,                         
                             In harmony, they sing along,                       
                             Beneath the vast and endless skies.                
                                                                                
                             The world, anew with each sunrise,                 
                             Promises of hope and grace,                        
                             In every shadow, light defies,                     
                             And dreams take flight in open space.              
                                                                                
                             So let your heart embrace the morn,                
                             With courage, love, and dreams untold,             
                             For in each day, new paths are born,               
                             And stories of the soul unfold.
