Griptape is a platform designed to help developers build, deploy, and scale end-to-end solutions, particularly those powered by large language models (LLMs). It offers tools for data preparation, retrieval, AI agents, pipelines, and workflows. Griptape provides an open-source AI framework and an execution runtime called Griptape AI Cloud.

Key features of Griptape include:

- **Build & Secure**: Developers can build business logic using Python, enhancing security, performance, and reducing costs with Off-Promptâ„¢ technology.
- **Deploy & Scale**: It allows for the deployment and running of ETL, RAG, and other structures without managing infrastructure, enabling seamless scaling.
- **Manage & Monitor**: Users can monitor performance, reliability, and spending, and enforce policies across the organization.

Griptape AI Framework offers abstractions for building AI agents, systems of agents, pipelines, workflows, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) implementations without needing extensive knowledge of Gen AI or prompt engineering.

Griptape AI Cloud handles infrastructure management, hosting everything from data processing pipelines to serverless application runtimes. It includes features like automated data preparation (ETL), retrieval as a service (RAG), and structure runtime (RUN) for building AI agents and workflows.
