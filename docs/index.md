# Griptape Documentation

Welcome to the official Griptape Documentation!
Here, you’ll find everything you need to build, deploy, and scale generative AI applications with Griptape.
The documentation is divided into the following sections:

## Griptape Nodes

The Griptape Nodes [docs](https://docs.griptapenodes.com) cover our visual AI development platform, [Griptape Nodes](https://www.griptapenodes.com).
Learn how to create AI workflows and applications using a drag-and-drop interface with visual building blocks, or extend functionality with Python scripting for more advanced customization.

## Griptape Cloud

The Griptape Cloud [docs](griptape-cloud/index.md) cover our cloud offering, [Griptape Cloud](https://www.griptape.ai/cloud).
Learn how to set up RAG pipelines, code hosting, custom Tools for LLM Agents, and more. All features are accessible through a [powerful API](./griptape-cloud/api/api-reference.md).

## Griptape Framework

The Griptape Framework [docs](griptape-framework/index.md) cover our open-source library, [Griptape](https://github.com/griptape-ai/griptape).
Explore how to create robust generative AI (genAI) applications using Griptape’s flexible abstractions and built-in tools.

## Griptape Framework Reference

The Griptape Framework Reference [docs](reference/griptape/index.md) provide auto-generated, detailed documentation of the Griptape codebase.
Here, you can look up classes, methods, and modules to better understand how to use Griptape.

## Griptape Trade School

[Griptape Trade School](https://learn.griptape.ai) provides guided tutorials for building a range of projects with Griptape.
This is a great starting point if you’re new to genAI or coding in general.
