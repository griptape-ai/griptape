# Getting Started with Data Sources

In many cases, you need an application to use highly specific and detailed data, data that is very recent or constantly updating, or sensitive data that simply isn't available to LLMs during training.

Here are some examples:

- The contents of your Enterprise wiki to power a search assistant
- Support articles for customer service automation
- Customer feedback or reviews to perform sentiment analysis
- Product details to generate purchase recommendations
- News and press releases for summarization & fact checking
- Financial reports for cost analysis
- Technical documents for compliance monitoring or risk assessment

In these cases, you will need to connect external data sources to your application.
