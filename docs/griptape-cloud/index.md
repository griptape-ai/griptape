# Griptape Cloud

[Griptape Cloud](https://cloud.griptape.ai/) provides managed services for your AI app stack. Deploy and scale end-to-end solutions, from LLM-powered data prep and retrieval to AI Agents, Pipelines, and Workflows.

## Build Your Own RAG Pipeline

Connect to your data with our [Data Sources](data-sources/create-data-source.md) and prepare them for retrieval with [Knowledge Bases](knowledge-bases/create-knowledge-base.md).

## Host and Run Your Code

Have Griptape code? Have existing code with another LLM framework? You can host your Python code using [Structures](structures/create-structure.md) whether it uses the Griptape Framework or not.

## Augment LLM requests with Tools

Create custom actions that LLMs can perform with [Tools](tools/create-tool.md). Tools in the cloud are instances of [Griptape Framework Tools](/griptape-tools/index.md) and can be run from anywhere with a simple API call or through Griptape Framework's [GriptapeCloudToolTool](/griptpe-tools/official-tools/griptape-cloud-tool-tool.md).

## Store Configuration for LLM Agents

[Rules and Rulesets](rules/rulesets.md) enable rapid and collabortive iteration for managing LLM behavior. [Threads and Messages](threads/threads.md) allow for persisted and editable conversation memory across any LLM invocation.

## APIs

All of our features can be called via API with a [Griptape Cloud API Key](https://cloud.griptape.ai/configuration/api-keys). See the [API Reference](api/api-reference.md) for detailed information.
