# VariationImageGenerationEngine

This Tool allows LLMs to generate variations of an input image from a text prompt. The input image can be provided either by its file path or by its [Task Memory](../../griptape-framework/structures/task-memory.md) reference. 

## Referencing an Image by File Path

```python
--8<-- "docs/griptape-tools/official-tools/src/variation_image_generation_client_1.py"
```

## Referencing an Image in Task Memory

```python
--8<-- "docs/griptape-tools/official-tools/src/variation_image_generation_client_2.py"
```
