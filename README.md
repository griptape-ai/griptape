Griptape is a Python framework designed to simplify the development of generative AI (genAI) applications.
It offers a set of straightforward, flexible abstractions for working with areas such as Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and much more.

## 🛠️ Core Components

### 🏗️ Structures

- 🤖 **Agents** consist of a single Task, configured for Agent-specific behavior.
- 🔄 **Pipelines** organize a sequence of Tasks so that the output from one Task may flow into the next.
- 🌐 **Workflows** configure Tasks to operate in parallel.

### 📝 Tasks

Tasks are the core building blocks within Structures, enabling interaction with Engines, Tools, and other Griptape components.

### 🧠 Memory

- 💬 **Conversation Memory** enables LLMs to retain and retrieve information across interactions.
- 🗃️ **Task Memory** keeps large or sensitive Task outputs off the prompt that is sent to the LLM.
- 📊 **Meta Memory** enables passing in additional metadata to the LLM, enhancing the context and relevance of the interaction.

### 🚗 Drivers

Drivers facilitate interactions with external resources and services in Griptape. 
They allow you to swap out functionality and providers with minimal changes to your business logic.

#### LLM & Orchestration
- 🗣️ **Prompt Drivers**: Manage textual and image interactions with LLMs.
- 🤖 **Assistant Drivers**: Enable interactions with various “assistant” services.
- 📜 **Ruleset Drivers**: Load and apply rulesets from external sources.
- 🧠 **Conversation Memory Drivers**: Store and retrieve conversational data.
- 📡 **Event Listener Drivers**: Forward framework events to external services.
- 🏗️ **Structure Run Drivers**: Execute structures locally or in the cloud.

#### Retrieval & Storage
- 🔢 **Embedding Drivers**: Generate vector embeddings from textual inputs.
- 🔀 **Rerank Drivers**: Rerank search results for improved relevance.
- 💾 **Vector Store Drivers**: Manage the storage and retrieval of embeddings.
- 🗂️ **File Manager Drivers**: Handle file operations on local and remote storage.
- 💼 **SQL Drivers**: Interact with SQL databases.

#### Multimodal
- 🎨 **Image Generation Drivers**: Create images from text descriptions.
- 🗣️ **Text to Speech Drivers**: Convert text to speech.
- 🎙️ **Audio Transcription Drivers**: Convert audio to text.

#### Web
- 🔍 **Web Search Drivers**: Search the web for information.
- 🌐 **Web Scraper Drivers**: Extract data from web pages.

#### Observability
- 📈 **Observability Drivers**: Send trace and event data to observability platforms.

### 🔧 Tools

Tools provide capabilities for LLMs to interact with data and services.
Griptape includes a variety of [built-in Tools](https://docs.griptape.ai/stable/griptape-framework/tools/official-tools/), and makes it easy to create [custom Tools](https://docs.griptape.ai/stable/griptape-framework/tools/custom-tools/).

### 🚂 Engines

Engines wrap Drivers and provide use-case-specific functionality:

- 📊 **RAG Engine** is an abstraction for implementing modular Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines.
- 🛠️ **Extraction Engine** extracts JSON or CSV data from unstructured text.
- 📝 **Summary Engine** generates summaries from textual content.
- ✅ **Eval Engine** evaluates and scores the quality of generated text.

### 📦 Additional Components

- 📐 **Rulesets** steer LLM behavior with minimal prompt engineering.
- 🔄 **Loaders** load data from various sources.
- 🏺 **Artifacts** allow for passing data of different types between Griptape components.
- ✂️ **Chunkers** segment texts into manageable pieces for diverse text types.
- 🔢 **Tokenizers** count the number of tokens in a text to not exceed LLM token limits.

## Hello World Example

Here's a minimal example of griptape:


```python
from griptape.drivers.prompt.openai import OpenAiChatPromptDriver
from griptape.rules import Rule
from griptape.tasks import PromptTask

task = PromptTask(
    prompt_driver=OpenAiChatPromptDriver(model="gpt-4o"),
    rules=[Rule("Keep your answer to a few sentences.")],
)

result = task.run("How do I do a kickflip?")

print(result.value)
```

```text
To do a kickflip, start by positioning your front foot slightly angled near the middle of the board and your back foot on the tail.
Pop the tail down with your back foot while flicking the edge of the board with your front foot to make it spin.
Jump and keep your body centered over the board, then catch it with your feet and land smoothly. Practice and patience are key!
```
